  "content": "I am pregnant and I\u2019m due next week. My water is breaking for last two days. It\u2019s not much, only a little bit of water comes out every hour. It\u2019s clear and not mixed with blood. I don\u2019t have any pain or contraction. I don\u2019t have fever either. People around me are saying that this happens when you are almost due and since there is no blood it\u2019s not a big deal. What should I do? I live in a remote area. The nearest hospital is pretty far from here. Do I have to go to the hospital right away or can I wait for my due date? If I should wait, then do I have to take any medicine for this?\r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: Once your water breaks, you should go to doctor immediately. The chance of infection is very high after 18 hours from water breaking. This is bad for your baby as well. You should immediately go to the hospital or see your obstetrician without further delay.\tPregnant Mom\r\nWater Breaking**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
