I am really worried this time.The pediatrician said that it is a normal thing for babies. But if this keeps going on like this he\u2019ll end up with no food in his stomach.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also noticed that his stool is quite sticky. Is this normal?\r\nHe also seems to be a bit restless. He keeps twisting and turning all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Gently pat on the back after feeding your baby \u2013 it will help him burp and prevent throwing up. If you think your baby is throwing up a lot, you can give your baby simethicone drop.  Sticky stool is normal for his age.** \r\n",
