  "content": "I am in my 5th month of pregnancy. Now I\u2019m having pain in my stomach. The pain comes and goes. I feel gas forming my stomach. I took some homeopathic medicine for this. But that doesn\u2019t help much.\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t gone for any checkup since I got pregnant. I can feel the baby moving inside me but I am not sure if it\u2019s moving much. How can I understand that the baby is alright?\r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: Four routine checkups are must during pregnancy. You should go immediately to the nearest health complex for a checkup where some blood & urine tests and an ultrasonography will be done. Also take folic acid and calcium supplements. \r\nThe abdominal pain may be due to gas. You may try pantoprazole tablets for this. Avoid lifting heavy weights**\r\n",
