  "content": "I've realised something about myself - I'm not very easy to live with when I'm\npregnant. When I was pregnant with my first child, I remember being surprised\nat how angry I would get with my husband. We had terrible fights! But now I\u2019m\nquite sure it was just the pregnancy hormones. Thankfully once my daughter was\nborn things settled down. But it didn't do my marriage much good. Now, ten\nyears later, I\u2019m pregnant with twins. And those crazy pregnancy hormones are\nplaying with my moods again! There have been a few days when I really and\ntruly just lost my temper. But this time it\u2019s not just my husband who has had\nto deal with my moods. Recently, I stormed off down a dirt road crying my eyes\nout in anger at something so small I can\u2019t even remember what it was. Last\nweek, I sulked in a room on my own when we visited my husband\u2019s family for\ndinner. When I came out, I found my husband had had taken my advice and gone\nhome without me! I also shouted at friends who were staying in our home with\nus when I came home from my job to find the dishes unwashed! Then there was\nthe day I slammed our front door in the face of somebody who was trying to\nsell me vegetables. I even burst into tears when somebody said something kind\nto me and helped me into the train carriage! Thank goodness the rollercoaster\nis almost over... I just hope that I will be forgiven for my mood swings by\nthe time baby comes. **MAMA HELP: It's common to have mood swings during\npregnancy. This is partly because of the change you face in your life. It is\nalso partly because of the rise in hormone levels in your body. This can\naffect your mood, making you feel tearful or easily irritated.**\n\n",
