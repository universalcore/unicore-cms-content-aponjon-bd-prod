It must be a cherishable moment for a pregnant mother to nurture positive thoughts.But for me things are quiet different. My back hurts all the time. Lately, I can\u2019t sleep at all, as I cannot turn while lying on the bed. Now I feel dizzy all the time. I try to think positive all the time and try to maintain a healthy routine. But nothing seems to help.\r\nMy doctor said that the baby\u2019s head is upwards. For that I\u2019ve been told do another ultrasonography. Can that hurt my baby?\r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: You can use warm compression and take a paracetamol tablet after meal if your back hurts a lot. Avoid lifting heavy weight. Try reading some books at bedtime \u2013 this will help you sleep.\r\nUltrasonography is absolutely safe \u2013 it will not hurt your baby.**\r\n",
