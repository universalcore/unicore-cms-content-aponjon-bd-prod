  "content": "My baby is 9 months old. His weight is 7 kg. He\u2019s not eating much solid food other than breastfeed. Whatever breastfeed he\u2019s taking that\u2019s also pretty little. \r\nWe\u2019ve tried giving him khichuri, mashed rice and milk, potato, fish, fruits and everything. He eats everything but only a small bit. Whenever we try to feed him a little more, he starts crying. It\u2019s like he just doesn\u2019t want to eat anything other than breast-milk. \r\n\r\nI am worried that he isn\u2019t getting enough food and he\u2019s not growing enough. Is his weight enough for the age? \r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: Be patient.Try giving your baby different food at different time. See what he likes. Give him more of the food he likes. Encourage him to eat. Gradually, he will develop a habit. \r\nYour child would\u2019ve been underweight if it were any less. You can give him vitamin syrup as well.**\r\n",
