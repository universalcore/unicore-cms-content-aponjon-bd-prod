  "content": "My baby is 4 months old. Since he was born he has chronic constipation. Sometimes it\u2019s more than 10 days between two motions. It\u2019s been 4 days since he\u2019s passed stool the last time. And the wind he passes smells very bad. He doesn\u2019t want to drink milk either. Sometimes I have to feed him only when he\u2019s asleep. I only give him breast-milk. He\u2019s also got runny nose for the last 2 weeks. He doesn\u2019t have fever or cough though. My poor baby! He must have been feeling so bad .I feel so helpless. As a mother what to do now? Should I give him something to relieve constipation? How can I treat his runny nose?\r\n\r\nWhat to do for this? \r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: If he doesn\u2019t pass stool for next 2 days you can use glycerin suppository. Sometimes constipation is caused by underlying medical condition or birth defect. You should consult a pediatrician to rule this out.\r\nFor runny nose you can give your baby antihistamine syrup. Keep the nostrils clean by wiping with wet cotton.**\r\n",
