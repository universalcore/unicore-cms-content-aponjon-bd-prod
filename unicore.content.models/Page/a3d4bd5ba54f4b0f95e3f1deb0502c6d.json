  "content": "Please help me. My due date for delivery was yesterday. Day before yesterday I was having pain which it became worse after drinking water from the local healers. After resting a while I was feeling better, the pain was gone. But I  feel the baby no longer moves.whereas I could feel a little movement in the morning. Yesterday the baby didn\u2019t move at all. \r\nAnd the pain becomes really bad at night, but in the morning I feel alright. I feel the pain right below the navel and when the pain comes, my belly becomes stiff.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do now?\r\n\r\n**APONJON HELP: No movement of the baby at this stage is a danger sign. Go to the nearest hospital immediately. The doctors will assess your baby\u2019s health. An ultrasonography may be needed. After proper physical examination he will decide whether a normal vaginal delivery or caesarean section is required. They will also see if your cervix is dilated.\r\nSince you are already due, labor can be induced medically as well. And please avoid going to the local healers. It will do more bad than good.**\r\n",
